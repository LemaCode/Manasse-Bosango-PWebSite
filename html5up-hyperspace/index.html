									<h2>Delving into Computer Science: My Academic Pursuits</h2>
									<p>As a third-year undergraduate student at Seattle University, I am deeply immersed in my Bachelor of Computer Science program, concentrating on Programming, Computer Software, and Algorithms. My coursework challenges me to explore the depths of computational theory and practical application. Whether it’s unraveling the complexities of C++ multiple inheritance or implementing a doubly linked list, I am constantly engaged in solving intricate problems. These challenges are not just academic exercises; they are opportunities to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills that will shape my future career. Projects like the Cloud Workflow Builder and Cloud IDE have allowed me to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios, enhancing my skills in cloud computing and software development. Working on these projects has been a transformative experience, demonstrating the power of technology to innovate and solve real-world problems. My academic journey is a blend of rigorous study and hands-on experience, equipping me with the tools needed for a successful career in technology. Each challenge I tackle reaffirms my belief that perseverance and passion are key to transforming dreams into reality. In the world of computer science, every line of code is a step toward creating a better, more connected world.</p>

									<h2>Balancing Studies with Enriching Extracurriculars</h2>
									<p>Outside the classroom, I make sure to keep my life balanced with a variety of activities. I have a passion for game development and am currently working on a Unity project that involves designing and implementing game data interactions. This project is a fantastic outlet for my creativity and technical skills, allowing me to bring my ideas to life and share them with others. I also enjoy volunteering and community service, which have taught me the value of giving back and staying connected with those around me. Through these experiences, I have discovered the joy of contributing to something greater than myself. Moreover, I love to participate in cultural events, especially those organized by the International Student Center. These activities not only provide a break from my academic responsibilities but also enrich my university experience, allowing me to grow as an individual and professional. Engaging in these diverse pursuits has shown me that true fulfillment comes from balancing ambition with compassion, and that each moment spent helping others adds profound meaning to my journey. My extracurricular activities have become a vital part of my life, teaching me that success is not only measured by academic achievements but also by the positive impact we make on our community.</p>

									<h2>Exploring Beyond the Classroom: My Journey at Seattle University</h2>
									<p>At Seattle University, my days are packed with engaging activities and responsibilities that extend well beyond the classroom. One of my most rewarding roles is as an Orientation Leader. Guiding new students through their first days on campus allows me to share my experiences and help them feel at home. Seeing the excitement and nervousness in their eyes reminds me of my own journey and inspires me to be the mentor I once needed. Additionally, I'm actively involved with the International Student Center, where I participate in events and provide support to fellow international students. This role has given me the chance to celebrate our diverse cultures and build a community where everyone feels included. I also cherish my time volunteering at the Bellevue College Computer Science Department, where I assist with student lab orientations and other activities. These roles have not only honed my leadership and communication skills but also allowed me to make meaningful connections within the university community. Embracing these opportunities has taught me that leadership is about service, and making a positive impact on others is the most rewarding achievement. By stepping out of my comfort zone and engaging with my peers, I’ve learned that the true essence of education lies in the relationships we build and the lives we touch.</p>
